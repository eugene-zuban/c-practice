# c-practice
Practicing C language: small and easy code examples on C for fun.

This repo includes small solutions written on C using different sources for ideas:

1. A part of the code examples and ideas are based on "Programming in C" book written by Stephen G. Kochan.

2. Another part of the code are solutions to the coding tasks from "Cracking the Coding Interview" book written by Gaylee Laakmann McDowell.

### Solutions to the "Cracking the Coding Interview" tasks.

**Arrays and Strings**
1. Determine if a string has all unique characters. [Code: String unique characters check.](https://github.com/jack-zuban/c-practice/tree/master/unique-characters/unique-characters/main.c)

2. Determine if one of the two given string is a permutation of the other. [Code: Strings permutation check.](https://github.com/jack-zuban/c-practice/blob/master/string-permutation-check/string-permutation-check/main.c)

3. URLfy: a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. The algorithm in my code does replacements from the end of the string. [Code: replacing spaces using pointers.](https://github.com/jack-zuban/c-practice/tree/master/URLfy/URLfy/main.c)
